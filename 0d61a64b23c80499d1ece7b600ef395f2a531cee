  * Add dpkg-buildflags call on plugins built too.
    Thanks Simon Ruderich for finding out, the nice patch and
    clarification. (Closes: #655130)
  * /run transition: Replaced usage of /dev/.udev with /run/udev,
    when checking for the usage of udev. Depend on initscripts
    (>= 2.88dsf-13.3) to guarantee the existence of /run/udev
    in case udev is being used. (Closes: #644321)
