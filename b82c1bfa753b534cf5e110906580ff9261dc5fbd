  * Avoid sending ICMP redirects when using tun devices and "subnet"
    topology. Thanks Simon Deziel for testing and the patch.
    (Closes: #656241)
    The init.d script will set all.send_redirects=0 when using "dev tun"
    and "topology subnet". More info in README.Debian.
  * Several manpage fixes
