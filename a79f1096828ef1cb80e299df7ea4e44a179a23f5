    Thanks ron@debian.org for noting this first. (Closes: #288669)
  * New upstream release.
  * Updated README.Debian with info on plugins.
  * Built and installed plugins. Thanks Michael Renner for noticing.
    (Closes: #284224)

  * WARNING: This version changes the default port (5000 previously)
    to 1194 (assigned by INANA). This will affect you if you don't
    have a 'port' option specified in your configuration files.
    Added a debconf note about it.
  * Updated es.po.
  * Patched ssl.c to fix bug in --key-method 1, that prevented

    Thanks James for the prompt answer & patch.
    Thanks weasel for finding it out.
  * New upstream releases. Fixes the "Assertion failed at crypto.c"
    (Closes: #265632, #270005)
  * Updated README.Debian with clearer 2.x vs 1.x interoperability
    instructions.
  * Put if-{up,down}.d scripts back in place, this time they work.
    Just remember to quote shell vars when checking if they are empty.
    [ -n "$VAR" ] -> Good     [ -n $VAR ] -> BAD
    Note to self, don't trust people's patches even if they are DD.
  * Removed if-{up,down}.d scripts until I get to know how they work.
  * Corrected names of if-{up,down}.d scripts. Duh!
  * New upstream release.
  * Renamed package to 1.99 to make it clearer that we're using
    version 2.0 and not 1.6. Some people rather talk about this on IRC
    and not tell the maintainer directly.
  * Added Brazilian Portuguese debconf templates. (Closes: #279351)
  * Modified init.d script so that specifying a daemon option in a
    VPN configuration won't make it fail. 
    Thanks Christoph Biedl for the patch. (Closes: #278302)
  * Added scripts to allow specifying 'openvpn name' in
    /etc/network/interfaces to have the tunnel created and destroyed with
    the device it runs over. Thanks Joachim Breitner for the patch.
    (Closes: #273481)

    want missing in Sarge.

    (Closes: #266927, #270477)
