  * Add better_systemd_detection.patch to avoid calling systemd-ask-password
    under upstart. Backported from upstream. (Closes: #747265)
  * Add systemd unit and generator from current Debian package. This avoids
    using the init.d script, which unnecessarily blocks lightdm startup on the
    network becoming online even if there are no auto-start connections
    (LP: #1443489).
