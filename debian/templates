_Description: Would you like to start openvpn sooner?
 Previous versions of openvpn started at the same time as most of other
 services. This means that most of these services couldn't use openvpn
 since it may have been unavailable when they started. Newer versions of the
 openvpn package will start earlier. (i.e. a S16openvpn link in rc[235].d
 instead of a S20openvpn)
 .
 If you accept here, the package upgrade will make this change for you.
 If you refuse, nothing will change, and openvpn will be working just like
 it did before.

Template: openvpn/create_tun
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Create the TUN/TAP device?
 If you choose this option, the /dev/net/tun device
 needed by OpenVPN will be created.
 .
 You should not choose this option if you're using devfs.

Template: openvpn/stop2upgrade
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Stop OpenVPN when upgraded?
 The upgrade process stops the running daemon before 
 installing the new version. If you are installing or upgrading the
 system remotely, that could break the upgrade process.
 .
 Unless upgrades are performed locally, you should choose to not stop
 OpenVPN before it is upgraded. The installation process will restart it once
 the upgrade is completed.
 .
 This option will take effect for the next upgrade.

Template: openvpn/default_port
Type: note
# NOT REVIEWED, obsolete
_Description: Default port has changed
 OpenVPN's default port has changed from 5000 to 1194 (IANA assigned).
 If you don't specify the port to be used on your VPNs, this upgrade
 may break them. 
 .
 Use the option 'port 5000' if you want to keep the old port
 configuration, or take a look at your firewall rules to
 allow the new default port configuration to work.

Template: openvpn/change_init2
Type: boolean
Default: false
# NOT REVIEWED, obsolete
_Description: Would you like to stop openvpn later?
 Previous versions of openvpn stopped at the same time as most of other
 services. This meant that some of services stopping later couldn't use 
 openvpn since it may have been stopped before them. Newer versions of the
 openvpn package will stop the service later. (i.e. a K80openvpn link in 
 rc[06].d instead of a K20openvpn)
 .
 If you accept here, the package upgrade will make this change for you.
 If you refuse, nothing will change, and openvpn will be working just like
 it did before.

Template: openvpn/vulnerable_prng
Type: note
_Description: Vulnerable random number generator
 A weakness has been discovered in the random number generator used by OpenSSL
 on Ubuntu and Debian systems.  As a result of this weakness, certain
 encryption keys are generated much more frequently than they should be, such
 that an attacker could guess the key through a brute-force attack given minimal
 knowledge of the system.
 .
 Any keys created on a vulnerable system may be affected by this problem. The
 'openssl-vulnkey' command may be used as a partial test for RSA keys with
 certain bit sizes, and the 'openvpn-vulnkey' for OpenVPN shared secret keys.
 Users are urged to verify their keys or simply regenerate any server or client
 certificates and keys in use on the system.
