Subject: [PATCH] Drop too-short control channel packets instead of asserting
 out.

This fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability where an authenticated client
could stop the server by triggering a server-side ASSERT().

OpenVPN would previously ASSERT() that control channel packets have a
payload of at least 4 bytes. An authenticated client could trigger this
assert by sending a too-short control channel packet to the server.

Thanks to Dragana Damjanovic for reporting the issue.

This bug has been assigned CVE-2014-8104.
