Subject: [PATCH] Fix using to_link buffer after freed

When I refactored the tls_state_change method in
9a7b95fda5 I accidentally changed a break into
a return true while it should return a false.

The code here is extremely fragile in the sense
that it assumes that settings a keystate to S_ERROR
cannot have any outgoing buffer or we will have a
use after free.  The previous break and now restored
return false ensure this by skipping any further
tls_process_state loops that might set to ks->S_ERROR
and ensure that the to_link is sent out and cleared
before having more loops in tls_state_change.

CVE: 2023-46850

This affects everyone, even with tls-auth/tls-crypt enabled.
