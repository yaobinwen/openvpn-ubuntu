  * Merge with Debian unstable (LP: #1536568). Remaining Ubuntu changes:
    - debian/openvpn.init.d:
      + Do not use start-stop-daemon and </dev/null to avoid blocking boot.
      + Show per-VPN result messages.
      + Add "--script-security 2" by default for backwards compatabliity.
    - Demote easy-rsa to Suggests
  * New upstream release. (Closes: #804368)
    Drop password_prompt_in_systemd.patch. Applied upstream.
  * Unify pidfile path on systemd and sysV. (Closes: #811010)
    Thanks Guillem Jover for noticing.
  * Increase start-stop-daemon timeout on stop to let openvpn
    tear down the connection properly in some cases.
    (Closes: #799592, #796914)
  * Add CAP_AUDIT_WRITE to openvpn@.service CapabilityBoundingSet
    to fix auth-pam plugin. (Closes: #795313)

    to avoid hidding possible password prompts. (Closes: #803032)

    environment clean. (Closes: #765447)
