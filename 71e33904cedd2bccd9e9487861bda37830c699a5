  * Automated backport upload; no source changes.
  * postinst: call 'restart' when 'cond-restart' fails due to user
    not upgrading the init.d script. (Closes: #308926)

    the need to test if it exists and saves the init.d script from
    failing.  (Closes: #306588)
  * Modified pam plugin to load libpam.so.0 instead of libpam.so.
    (Closes: #306335)

    Thanks Thomas Hood for the patch.

    Now it's more useful and complete. (Closes: #304895)
  * init.d script: 
     - Fixed restarting of multiple VPNs
     - Fixed TAB converted to spaces.
     - Remove status file on VPN stop
     - Respect 'status' option if given in the config file
     - New /etc/default/openvpn configuration file that allows
       control on which VPNs are automatically started and also
       controls status file refresh interval
     Thanks Philipp A. Hartmann for the nice patch. (Closes: #294332)
   * init.d script: Added cond-restart to only restart VPNs in use.

     (Closes: #280464)
