  * Merge with Debian (LP: #279655), remaining diffs:
    - debian/openvpn.init.d: Added 'status' action to init script, show
      per-VPN result messages and add "--script-security 2" by default for
      backwards compatibility
    - debian/control: Added lsb-base>=3.2-14 depend to allow status_of_proc()
  * Fixes regression when calling commands with arguments (LP: #277447)
  * New upstream version
    - Fixes TLS negotiation problems (Closes: #496649)
  * Patched options.c, socket.c and socket.h to correctly check
    for MAC addresses on lladdr parm. (Closes: #496141)
    Thanks hoverhell@gmail.com for the patch.
  * init.d script: exit with 0 status when trying to start
    an already running VPN. (Closes: #499247)
  * New upstream version.
    - Fixed calls to external commands with arguments.
      (Closes: #495964, #496314, #497411)
